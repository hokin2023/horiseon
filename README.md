# Horiseon Homework 1

## Description

- My biggest motivation of this project is to learn the basic structure of HTML page, the importance of semnatic elements, Github links, and how to deploy application properly.
- Building this project will help me one step closer to success and help me understand the fundamental resources and skills that I need to build an application.
- I replaced Div elements with semantic elements for the HTML file. I also combined mutiple classes and elements in one single line to avoid repeating them in CSS file. 
- I didn't use semantic elements for HTML file and group styling for CSS before. Now, I understand the importance of those and know how to apply it properly.
